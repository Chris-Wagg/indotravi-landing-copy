## About this project

This will be a portfolio project to copy the design of a mock up travel website. I will use tailwind mainly for my styling alongside a components library (decided at a late time)

Hopefully though this project I'll become more familiar with tailwind and have the chance to learn some new things about design and single web page developoment.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
